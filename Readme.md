# Guvi-RoadMapTask Day-6

This repository contains the completed tasks for Day 6 of the GUVI Zen class, focusing on JavaScript classes and object-oriented programming concepts.

## Overview

Day 6 tasks include implementing JavaScript classes for various scenarios, including movie representation, UML diagram conversion, person details handling, and Uber price calculation.

### Day 6 Task:

1. **Task 1: Movie Class Implementation**
   - Objective:
     - Implement a `Movie` class with properties `title`, `studio`, and `rating`.
     - Write a constructor that sets these properties based on provided arguments.
     - Set the default rating to "PG" when no rating is provided.
     - Implement a method `getPG` to filter movies with a rating of "PG" from an array of `Movie` instances.
     - Create an instance of `Movie` for "Casino Royale" with specific details.

2. **Task 2: Convert UML diagram to JavaScript Class**
   - Objective:
     - Convert a UML diagram (specifically `circleClass`) to a JavaScript class, ensuring properties and methods are accurately represented.

3. **Task 3: Person Class Implementation**
   - Objective:
     - Implement a `Person` class to hold details such as name, age, gender, and any other relevant information.

4. **Task 4: Uber Price Calculation Class**
   - Objective:
     - Write a class to calculate Uber prices based on factors like distance, time, surge pricing, etc.

## Conclusion

Day 6 tasks from GUVI Zen focused on applying object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript through class implementations for various scenarios.
